# Stretch Week Shenanigans

I've set out to complete the JS [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/), but strayed less than two days in and what was supposed to be a full time project ended up being a few hours a day along with my regular work. üòÅ Apart from that I also looked into writing backend tests for RoR apps.

### List of mini projects and notes that came to life in that one week

- [Boring Loan calculator:](./projects/boring-calculator/index.html) An extremely unexciting loan calculating calculator that, I can't believe it but it was actually in the video, uses a .gif for imitating a loader to make it seem like there are some hardcore calculations going on in the background when in reality it's literally just some basic division and multiplication.
- [Task List:](./projects/task-list/index.html) As it says. A task list. Saves to local storage.
- [Book List:](./projects/book-list/index.html) I first made a task list, then I made a book list. I'm not sure what exactly is the difference, but this one was harder to do.
- [Book List in ES6:](./projects/book-list-ES6/index.htmll) Same as booklist, just rewritten with some fancy ES6 classes. Unlike the previous one, it saves to local storage.
- [Joke Generator:](./projects/jokes-generator/index.html) fetches a # of Chuck Norris jokes from external API
- [Notes:](https://github.com/ursakacar/stretch-week-1/tree/master/notes) Collection of bland and unordered notes I was taking through lectures.
- [BONUS:](https://github.com/ursakacar/knjigored/pull/25/commits) Learned and wrote some autotests (and fixed some bugs) for an app I threw together a year ago.
